    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of
        changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine<br> to use or if there should be
        milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets.
        These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta
        keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot,
            celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5
            minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7
            minutes more.

            Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow
            steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

            Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth
            only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
    </ol>
